# Fraud-Detection
## Approach and Challenges
- I chose Online payment fraud detection dastaset, did some data preprocessing and cleaning over it and reduced the dataset size because it was taking a lot of time to train the model in different alogorithms
- i applied the learning alogrithms of only those which i felt would be relevant to Fraud dDetection and the ones i could cover up this week
- After comparing the scores in different models Random Forest seemed to be the best one out of all.
- I had challenges in understanding the math behind the models and understanding some of the concepts related the algortihms itself
